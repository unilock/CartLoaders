# CartLoaders

Makes Minecarts in motion load their surrounding chunks. Useful, for example, for sending Minecarts back across a long one-way railway.

Only tested on >=1.20.1, but probably works across many versions. Try it and see?

Warning: Do not use this as a traditional chunk loader; it will cause severe lag. Only have Minecarts moving when necessary.
